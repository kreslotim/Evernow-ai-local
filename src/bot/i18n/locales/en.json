Yes, they are still considered unscientific, but I believe and know that it works, so I help specifically within this methodology.\n\n<b>How can this be useful to me?</b>\nHave you ever noticed that people with similar appearances behave in similar ways? I have — many times. The face is a mirror of our character, and it changes along with it. Through facial features, we can recognize deep character traits that we may not be aware of. This helps grow in relationships, finances, health (according to psychotype).\n\nAlso, you can analyze relationship compatibility through faces, as well as learn more about strangers!\n\n<b>Do you store my photos? My analyses?</b>\nNo, we delete your photos immediately after analysis. That's why we ask you to upload a photo from scratch each time. We also don't store analyses — they are deleted after 1 day.\n\n<b>How can I get tokens for free?</b>\n1) every 3 invited friends give you 1 free token!\n2) in the referral program section you can find telegram channels, subscribing to which you'll get 1 more bonus token\n\n<b>Can I get a refund?</b>\nIf you've already spent tokens — no, the service has already been provided.
